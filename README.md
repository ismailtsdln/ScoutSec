# ScoutSec

**ScoutSec** — Modern Web Application Security Scanning Toolkit  
A unified passive and active scanning solution with advanced analysis, CI/CD integration, and comprehensive reporting.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Scanning
- **Passive Scanning**: Proxy-based traffic analysis to detect vulnerabilities without sending malicious payloads.
- **Active Scanning**: Targeted security fuzzing and payload injection with concurrent worker pools.
- **Advanced Analysis**: OWASP Top 10 detection patterns with custom payload support.

### Modern Web & SPA
- **Headless Browser**: JavaScript execution via `chromedp` for DOM-based vulnerability detection.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automated evidence collection for visual confirmation.
- **SPA Crawling**: JavaScript-aware link discovery for Single Page Applications.

### API Security
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Parse and automatically test REST API endpoints from spec files.
- **GraphQL Security**: Introspection detection, batch query DOS, and recursive query vulnerability testing.
- **API Fuzzing**: BOLA/IDOR checks, JSON/XML injection detection.

### Reporting
- **Multiple Formats**: Automated JSON and HTML report generation.
- **Severity Classification**: Risk-based categorization of findings.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Designed for seamless pipeline integration.
